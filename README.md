## Requirements

This project requires Docker and access to DockerHub.

The OpenAPI Specification is compatible with [Conjur OSS v1.9+](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur).
Clients are generated using [OpenAPI Generator v4.3.1](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/tree/v4.3.1).

Each Java Client version corresponds to a specific API version release, the API client having
its own version allows changes to be made to the client outside of updates to the API.
